ALC 3.0 Court Counter App
This is an ALC project Court Counter App. The app keeps track of scores and other plays in a football match by simulating 
adding numbers to a TextView with the click of a button.

When the reset button is clicked at the bottom of the app, all parameters are returned to their default values.
